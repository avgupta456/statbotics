# Statbotics

Statbotics aims to create and distribute modern data analytics for the FIRST Robotics Competition. Due to the multiple distinct components to this project, the code is stored in multiple repositories, and this repository serves as overarching documentation. Details for specific subsections can be accessed via the links below.

In the future, additional documentation, examples, and resources will be stored in this repository.

## Overview

Currently, we are focused on Elo Ratings, building upon Caleb Sykes' previous work. We're in the early stages, and hope to add content related to OPR, event prediction, and Zebra MotionWorks soon. Stay tuned!

Elo is a measure of a team's on-field strength, calculated using win margins from over 100,000 matches dating back to 2002. A Elo of 1500 is roughly average, and an Elo of 1800+ is in the top 1% worldwide. Head over to https://statbotics.io for tables and charts displaying Elo trends. Remember, this is just one method to rank teams, and shouldn't be taken too seriously ;)
