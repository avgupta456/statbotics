# Changelog

A semi-comprehensive list of changes for the 2024 season!

- District participation is now recorded on TeamYear objects instead of Team objects. This impacts teams that have competed in multiple districts and simplifies pulling data from TBA.
- Remove extra summary statistics (max, 95th percentile, median, mean, and standard deviation) from Year objects for total, auto, teleop, endgame, and RP EPAs.
