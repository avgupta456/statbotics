# Statbotics Scripts

The Statbotics scripts are Jupyter Notebooks (Python scripts) that interact with or explain other parts of the Statbotics project. This includes scripts to reproduce EPA model results, scripts to demonstrate the Python API, and scripts to answer questions using the database.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.8+.

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `poetry install`
2. Run the Jupiter Notebook server: `jupyter notebook`
3. Open the scripts in the browser at `localhost:8888`

## Structure

The scripts are structured as follows:

- `api/`: Scripts to demonstrate the Python API.
- `baselines/`: Scripts to reproduce EPA model results.

More coming soon!
