TODOS
 - normalize ELO by standard deviation?
 - move to Cloud Functions, figure out how to just push new matches (live updating)
 - Add a match model (re Caleb's message on best matches, biggest upsets, etc)
 - Add win/draw/loss results
 - elo doesn't account for ranking points (ex: 5511 2019)
 - region/district models?
